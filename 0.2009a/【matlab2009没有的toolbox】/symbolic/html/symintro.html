         <h1>Introduction</h1>
         <p>The Symbolic Math Toolbox&#8482; software uses "symbolic objects" produced by the "sym" function.  For example, the statement</p><pre class="codeinput">x = sym(<span class="string">'x'</span>);
</pre><p>produces a symbolic variable named x.</p>
         <p>You can combine the statements</p><pre class="codeinput">a = sym(<span class="string">'a'</span>); t = sym(<span class="string">'t'</span>); x = sym(<span class="string">'x'</span>); y = sym(<span class="string">'y'</span>);
</pre><p>into one statement involving the "syms" function.</p><pre class="codeinput">syms <span class="string">a</span> <span class="string">t</span> <span class="string">x</span> <span class="string">y</span>
</pre><p>You can use symbolic variables in expressions and as arguments to many different functions.</p><pre class="codeinput">r = x^2 + y^2

theta = atan(y/x)

e = exp(i*pi*t)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput"> 
r =
 
x^2 + y^2
 
 
theta =
 
atan(y/x)
 
 
e =
 
exp(pi*i*t)
 
</pre><p>It is sometimes desirable to use the "simple" or "simplify" function to transform expressions into more convenient forms.</p><pre class="codeinput">f = cos(x)^2 + sin(x)^2

f = simple(f)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput"> 
f =
 
cos(x)^2 + sin(x)^2
 
 
f =
 
1
 
</pre><p>Derivatives and integrals are computed by the "diff" and "int" functions.</p><pre class="codeinput">diff(x^3)

int(x^3)

int(exp(-t^2))
</pre><pre class="codeoutput"> 
ans =
 
3*x^2
 
 
ans =
 
x^4/4
 
 
ans =
 
(pi^(1/2)*erf(t))/2
 
</pre><p>If an expression involves more than one variable, differentiation and integration use the variable which is closest to 'x'
            alphabetically, unless some other variable is specified as a second argument. In the following vector, the first two elements
            involve integration with respect to 'x', while the second two are with respect to 'a'.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">[int(x^a), int(a^x), int(x^a,a), int(a^x,a)]
</pre><pre class="codeoutput"> 
ans =
 
[ piecewise([a = -1, log(x)], [a &lt;&gt; -1, x^(a + 1)/(a + 1)]), a^x/log(a), x^a/log(x), piecewise([x = -1, log(a)], [x &lt;&gt; -1, a^(x + 1)/(x + 1)])]
 
</pre><p>You can also create symbolic constants with the sym function.  The argument can be a string representing a numerical value.
             Statements like pi = sym('pi') and delta = sym('1/10') create symbolic numbers which avoid the floating point approximations
            inherent in the values of pi and 1/10.  The pi created in this way temporarily replaces the built-in numeric function with
            the same name.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">pi = sym(<span class="string">'pi'</span>)

delta = sym(<span class="string">'1/10'</span>)

s = sym(<span class="string">'sqrt(2)'</span>)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput"> 
pi =
 
pi
 
 
delta =
 
1/10
 
 
s =
 
sqrt(2)
 
</pre><p>Conversion of floating point values to symbolic constants involves some consideration of roundoff error.  For example, with
            either of the following statements, the value assigned to t is not exactly one-tenth.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">t = 1/10, t = 0.1
</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
t =

    0.1000


t =

    0.1000

</pre><p>The technique for converting floating point numbers is specified by an optional second argument to the sym function.  The
            possible values of the argument are 'f', 'r', 'e' or 'd'.  The default is 'r'.
         </p>
         <p>'f' stands for 'floating point'.  All values are represented in the form (2^e+N*2^(e-52)) or -(2^e+N*2^(e-52)) where N and
            e are integers. This captures the floating point values exactly.
         </p><pre class="codeinput">sym(t,<span class="string">'f'</span>)
</pre><pre class="codeoutput"> 
ans =
 
(2^-4+2702159776422298*2^-56)
 
</pre><p>'r' stands for 'rational'.  Floating point numbers obtained by evaluating expressions of the form p/q, p*pi/q, sqrt(p), 2^q
            and 10^q for modest sized integers p and q are converted to the corresponding symbolic form.  This effectively compensates
            for the roundoff error involved in the original evaluation, but may not represent the floating point value precisely.

</pre><pre class="codeoutput">
